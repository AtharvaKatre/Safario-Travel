                            fair-like atmosphere. Its impressive carnival rides and kid-friendly games are some of the
                            most exciting things to do in Los Angeles. Founded in 1909, this traditional amusement park
                            is where you can ride the iconic Santa Monica Pier Carousel, which dates back to the late
                            1930s.

                            Fairground rides typically cost between $5 and $10 each. Cycling is a popular activity as
                            the pier features a 26-mile-long pathway that runs parallel to the Pacific Ocean.</p>

                            sound stages for about $58 per person. The 2-hour studio tour takes place in the morning and

                            You may even catch some of your favourite TV shows being filmed during your tour. If you’re
                            a fan of ghost stories, Paramount Pictures Studios’ After Dark tour is a 2.5-hour-long
                            walking tour that includes a visit to the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

                            largest municipal parks in the USA. It offers a variety of things to do in Los Angeles for
                            visitors of all ages, including hiking, golfing, cycling, and horseback riding. There are
                            over 50 miles of trails, many of which are set close to waterfalls and lagoons within the
                            park.

                            You can also visit rare wildlife at the Los Angeles Zoo & Botanical Gardens, catch a concert
                            at the Greek Theatre, and enjoy panoramic views of Los Angeles at the Griffith Observatory.

                        <p class="card-text">Sunset Boulevard and the streets around it are lined with palm trees and
                            neon-lit billboards, resulting in beautiful snapshots. The most popular street is called
                            Sunset Strip, which runs through Hollywood and Beverly Hills.

                            Here, you can enjoy live music and stand-up comedy at legendary spots such as The Roxy
                            Theatre and The Laugh Factory. There are also plenty of excellent clubs and bars to hit up
                            in the evenings.

                        <p class="card-text">The iconic Hollywood Sign, standing at 44 feet, can be spotted from just
                            about anywhere in downtown Los Angeles. Erected on Mount Lee in 1923, there are 3 hiking
                            trails leading to the sign, with the shortest one spanning 3 miles and starting at the
                            Griffith Observatory parking lot.

                            If hiking to the summit sounds too strenuous, make your way to Lake Hollywood Park, which
                            has a great viewpoint of the landmark. Taking a photo of yourself with the sign in the
                            background is one of the best things to do in Los Angeles. </p>
