                            (Kōkyo) with its beautiful 17th-century parks surrounded by walls and moats. Still in use by
                            the Imperial family, the Imperial Palace stands on the site where, in 1457, the Feudal Lord
                            Ota Dokan built the first fortress, the focal point from which the city of Tokyo (or Edo, as
                            it was then) gradually spread.</p>

                            in New York, and much older. It has in fact been the commercial center of the country for
                            centuries, and is where five ancient roads connecting Japan's major cities all met. Lined by
                            exclusive shops and imposing palatial stores, the Ginza district is also fun to simply

                            the National Museum of Western Art (Kokuritsu Seiyō Bijutsukan). It was built in 1959 to
                            plans by famous Swiss architect Le Corbusier.

                            The exhibits, largely made up of works by important French artists, come mainly from the
                            collections of Japanese businessman and art collector Kojiro Matsukata, bought during visits
                            to Europe early in the 20th century.</p>
