                            Empire and the largest of their constructions to survive, remained a model for sports
                            facilities right up to modern times. Built by Vespasian in AD 72 and enlarged by the
                            addition of a fourth story by his son, Titus, it was a venue for public spectacles and shows
                            - even mock sea battles.</p>

                            Maria del Fiore, or the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, dominates the Florence skyline.
                            The cathedral was built between the 13th and 15th centuries, with the most famous piece
                            being the extraordinary dome, completed by Filippo Brunelleschi in 1434.

                        <p class="card-text">The Grand Canal is the largest and most famous of these waterways, cutting
                            a wide S-shaped route through the city. Along its sides are the grandest of the palaces once
                            owned by the wealthiest and most powerful families of the Venetian Republic. The best way to
                            see palaces, whose fronts face the water, is from a Vaporetto ride along
                            the Grand Canal.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">The still smoking volcano of Mt. Vesuvius looks down on the remains of the
                            city it destroyed in AD 79. But that same eruption also preserved many of the city's art
                            treasures: frescoes, mosaics, and sculptures that were encased in the lava as it cooled.
                            Several centuries of excavations have revealed the remains of houses, markets, baths,
                            temples, theaters, streets. </p>

                            attractions in the city of Pisa, one whose world fame comes not from the considerable
                            elegance of its design, but from a flaw. Work began on the tower in the 1100s, and the
                            sinking, which led to the lean, began by the time the tower reached the third story.</p>

                            Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola, and Riomaggiore can be reached by several means, joined to
                            each other by walking paths, a railroad that tunnels through the headlands to emerge at each
                            town.</p>
